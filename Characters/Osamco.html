		<h4>Land:</h4>
		<h5>Your land is the LAND OF TOGGLES AND SWITCHES. Your hive arrives compressing a large button. From a distance, it looks like a BALL full of BUMPS AND TOWERS, but a closer inspection would reveal the BUMPS to be LARGE BUTTONS, and the TOWERS to be similarly sized LEVERS. Some BUTTONS contain SMALLER BUTTONS AND LEVERS on them, needing to be pressed in a particular order to press the LARGEST BUTTON. The LEVERS are similarly designed. Making a mistake will reset all of the TOGGLES, and will assign them a new pattern. Once both of the largest TOGGLES are properly toggled, the BUTTON underneath your hive will decompress, revealing a door to the winding stairs to your DENIZEN. Unlike other Time players, your DENIZEN is OPIS. The Choice you will be presented with will be much easier, but with far less of a reward for choosing right. However, defeating OPIS grants you a much larger HOARD, and many other things well, such as FOOD, WATER, and WEAPONS.</h5>
