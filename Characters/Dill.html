		<h4>Land:</h4>
		<h5>Your land is the LAND OF BLOOD AND HELL. Your house arrives in a dark cave with a hole in the very high roof that lets light stream in, and offers a rather good view of your GATES and SKIA. The stone walls of your cave are greyish burgundy in colour. The cave leads off in one direction, sloping down at an increasing rate. It gets progressively hotter the further down you go.</h5>
