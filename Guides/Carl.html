		<h1>NO HOMO:</h1>
		<h2>The 12 steps to being straight</h2>
		<img src="../Characters/Images/SirCarl.png" alt="CARL">
		
		<h3>1.After every sentence that may or may not sound homosexual, always make sure to add a statement of your heterosexuality, typically in the form of "No Homo!"</h3>

		<h3>2.Make sure to like women. That's pretty important.</h3>

		<h3>3.Remember that hating women is the gayest thing anyone can possibly do.</h3>

		<h3>4.Have a bro. The cooler, the better.</h3>

		<h3>5.Love that bro, but in a brotherly way. Hence the title "Bro."</h3>

		<h3>6.If you wind up making out with that bro due to unforeseen circumstances, tell him "No Homo" so he knows the deal.</h3>

		<h3>7.Never, ever come out of the closet. If you find yourself in a closet, youâ€™re stuck there for good, unless you can find a way out of the closet without exiting the closet.</h3>

		<h3>8.Study <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0yFyW7Ysps">this</a> song closely.</h3>

		<h3>9.Study <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/137318293-mikes-guide-to-coolness">this</a> book extensively.</h3>

		<h3>10.Always use a really big and intrusive font. You must assert your dominance that way.</h3>

		<h3>11.Mike and Carl are two of the straightest names I've ever heard.</h3>

		<h3>12.The number 12 is the straightest number possible. Don't ask me why, it just is.</h3>
